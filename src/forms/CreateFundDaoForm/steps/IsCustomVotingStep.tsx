              E.g., you see that proposals are not reaching quorum so you want
              to lower it. But your proposals to change the quorum also donâ€™t
              reach the quorum. Here you can have a proposal to change quorum
              requirements for all proposal types with a lower quorum.

              You want the proposals that change general voting settings to have
              a higher barrier to avoid abuse and to be voted on by only large
              token holders. Here you can set the minimum voting threshold to a
              high level in order to achieve this.
